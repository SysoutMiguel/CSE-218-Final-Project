I used HashSet to store the words in the dictionary because of the effeciency of comparing if a given word is stored in the map or not. Also used Hash Table because I know the size of the list is fixed. The big O of checking if a hashmap contains an object is O(1).

The data structure I used to store the users was Red-Black tree. I used this because it stores values on a key, value, basis. This allows for quick lookups and quick insertions

For my posts I used LinkedList to store. This is due to the fact that it keeps an order in which they are inserted. I also used this for comments. Because when showing general post I need to have the most recent posts at the end. Vice versa for comments.
